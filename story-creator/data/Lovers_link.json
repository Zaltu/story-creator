The whole original aspect of the arcana pertaining to \"crossroads\" I feel may also pertain to parting ways as oppose to coming together, and knowing when roads must part again. The reverse actually being that the MC and this person stay together, just to spite the other person (who has already made their peace, and probably did nothing wrong per say).\n\nI think that in order for the \"random\" approaching the MC to make somewhat sense, this is a character that would have to have appeared in the past. It could be another social link which, as a side element, invloves a breakup. It could be a social link that's unlocked by repeatedly talking to certain NPCs while wandering around the maps. The characters would have to speak to each other at some point, one way or another.\n",
